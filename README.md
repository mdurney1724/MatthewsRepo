UT Austin Data Analysis and Visualization Boot Camp

Pymaceuticals, Inc. is a pharmaceutical company that is focused on the success of its on cancer treatment Capomulin.  In this project, we will use two csv files containing information on studies of different treatments to determine how successful Capolmulin is at treating tumors in mice.  Python, Pandas, Scipy, and Matplotlib are used to arrange the data, create dataframes, calculate vital statistical values, and create visualizations so that decision makers may easily derive valuable details to inform their decisions.
